# DSC106-ASSIGNMENT3
This is an assignment creating a Dashboard as showed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecu-bUlnjURqP6_om8RfkK1n6y8PDHrw/view.

The main tools I used is Highcharts, Javascript, CSS, HTML.

Best thanks to the examples on Highcharts web page, and also the contributions of tons of example online. Also, thanks to TAs who provided hints on how to establish a dashboard based on Zingcharts. 

The limitations of my dashboard is that 1) sometimes the synchronization chart might not be synchronized due to the fast movement of mouse. Therefore, when playing around my dashboard, PLEASE BE SLOW in moving mouse. 2) The second limitation of my dashboard is that my code is not efficient enough, requiring additional cleaning and combining. 3) The ways I constructed my data structure in this assignment might not be the best one.
